Day 18–32 Python Practice

**Author:** Qingxia Wang  
**Duration:** Day 18 – Day 32  
**Focus:** Python Data Structures & Algorithms (Trees, Graphs, DFS/BFS, Islands Problems)

---

Overview

This repository contains my Python algorithm and data structure practice for **Day 18 to Day 32** of my 12-week programming plan.  
It includes exercises on arrays, hash tables, trees, graphs, BFS/DFS, island counting problems, and logging for debugging.

Daily Progress

| Day | Topic | Practice / LeetCode |
|-----|-------|--------------------|
| 18–22 | Python logging + basic algorithm setup | Integrated logging into LeetCode problems |
| 23–25 | Arrays, Sets, and Hash Tables | Two Sum, Contains Duplicate, Valid Anagram |
| 26 | Binary Tree basics | Preorder / Inorder / Postorder traversal, Maximum Depth of Binary Tree |
| 27–28 | Graph representation & traversal | DFS/BFS using adjacency list, Flood Fill problem |
| 29–30 | Connected Components in Grid | Number of Islands, Max Area of Island |
| 31–32 | Advanced BFS/DFS on Graph | Pacific Atlantic Water Flow |

Key Concepts Practiced

- Tree traversal (DFS – preorder, inorder, postorder)  
- Graph traversal (DFS, BFS with queue)  
- Recursion fundamentals  
- Flood fill and island counting problems  
- Logging and debugging for algorithm tracing  
- Complexity analysis (O(n), O(m×n), etc.)

---

Tools Used

- Python 3.10+  
- VSCode  
- Git & GitHub  
- LeetCode as problem source

---

Next Steps

Next phase (starting Day 33):  
Data analysis and visualization using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** (Week 8 of the training plan).
